# Hi, I’m Enrico 👋

I’m a backend-focused full-stack engineer from Brazil, specializing in building reliable, high-performance systems with Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I enjoy solving hard performance and data problems: modeling data, tuning queries, and designing APIs and background workflows that scale.

- 🇧🇷 Based in Criciúma, SC – Brazil  
- 🗣 Languages: Portuguese (native), English (fluent), Italian (fluent)  
- 🎓 B.S. in Computer Science, UNESC (2022–2025)

## What I Do

- **Backend engineering:** Business logic, RESTful APIs, database design, and background processing.
- **Performance & scalability:** Query optimization, indexing, batching, and caching to keep systems fast under real load.
- **Data workflows:** ETL pipelines, data consistency, and automation across services and databases.
- **Full-stack delivery:** From backend to simple frontends with React, plus Dockerization and CI/CD.

---

## Highlights

- Cut a **critical item price update job** from ~6 hours to ~5 seconds by refactoring PostgreSQL queries and batch logic, massively improving daily operations.
- Optimized **high-traffic APIs** (50k+ requests/day) in Rails by tuning queries with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, B-tree and partial indexes, and SQL refactors, reducing response times from ~900ms to **<500ms**.
- Designed **robust Rails backends** using ActiveRecord, Service Objects, and Sidekiq with Redis, offloading heavy workloads to background jobs and shaving **2–4 seconds** off synchronous request times.
- Increased **system stability and delivery speed** with RSpec, FactoryBot, and structured migrations, cutting production regressions by ~50% and shrinking feature cycles from weeks to days.
